_This directory should stay here (altho empty) to prevent conflicts with sharing 
folders between the Guest and Host machine the first time the machine is booted._

This is the directory where you files will be synced between the guest and the
host. However, the ``.gitignore`` file, will tell Git to ignore everything but
this README.md file.

This is the default ROOT DOCUMENT folder for Ningx. Please ignore the `html`
subfolder, since its a nginx default on instalation.
