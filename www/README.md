_This directory should stay here (altho empty) to prevent conflicts with sharing 
folders between the Guest and Host machine the first time the machine is booted._

This is the directory where you files will be synced between the guest and the
host. However, the ``.gitignore`` file, will tell Git to ignore everything but
this readme and the file itself.
